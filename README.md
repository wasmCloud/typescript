- **Applications** (`apps/`) - Production applications built with wasmCloud
- **Examples** (`examples/`) - Sample components and usage patterns

## üì¶ Packages

### Core Libraries

- **[@wasmcloud/lattice-client-core](./packages/lattice-client-core/)** - Core TypeScript client for wasmCloud lattice operations
- **[@wasmcloud/lattice-client-react](./packages/lattice-client-react/)** - React hooks and components for wasmCloud lattice integration

### Development Tools

- **[@wasmcloud/eslint-config](./packages/eslint-config/)** - Shared ESLint configuration
- **[@wasmcloud/prettier-config](./packages/prettier-config/)** - Shared Prettier configuration  
- **[@wasmcloud/tsconfig](./packages/tsconfig/)** - Shared TypeScript configuration

## üöÄ Applications

- **[Washboard UI](./apps/washboard-ui/)** - Web-based dashboard for managing wasmCloud lattices

## üìö Examples

### Components

> [!NOTE]
> New to wasmCloud components in TypeScript?
>
> Start with the [wasmCloud TypeScript language guide][docs-ts]

[wasmCloud Components][docs-components] are WebAssembly components that serve as applications on the wasmCloud platform.

This repository includes examples of components written in TypeScript in the [`examples/components`][dir-components] directory.
